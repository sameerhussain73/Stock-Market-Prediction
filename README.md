# Stock Sentiment Analysis Using NLP

## Project Description

This project focuses on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiments in stock market news and its potential impact on stock prices. By processing and classifying news headlines, the project aims to predict market sentiment and contribute to the understanding of how news affects stock market movements.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of financial news headlines collected from various sources, which are labeled based on their implied sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) towards the stock market.

## Approach

### Data Preprocessing:
- **Text Cleaning**: Implementing text normalization techniques to clean and prepare the news headlines for analysis.
- **Tokenization and Vectorization**: Converting text data into a format suitable for machine learning models.

### Sentiment Analysis:
- **Model Building**: Employing NLP models to classify news headlines into sentiment categories.
- **Feature Engineering**: Experimenting with different NLP features to enhance model performance.

### Model Evaluation:
- **Performance Metrics**: Utilizing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's effectiveness in sentiment classification.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the correlation between news sentiments and stock market trends, demonstrating the impact of media on financial markets.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Main programming language for the project.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: For text processing and feature extraction.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing data and results.

## Usage

Instructions for setting up the project, preprocessing the data, conducting sentiment analysis, and evaluating the model are provided. Users can replicate the analysis, experiment with different NLP techniques, and apply the model to various datasets.
